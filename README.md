# Homie

Homie is an attempt to create wired smart-home devices.
Those devices are connected using [DOSE](https://riot-os.org/api/group__drivers__dose.html).

## Bus Interface

Every device has two *4P4C* jacks. This enables daisy-chaining the devices into one serial bus. The first and last device have to be terminated using a 120Î© resistor.

The bus interface:

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | GND         |
| 2   | CAN LOW     |
| 3   | CAN HIGH    |
| 4   | +5V         |


## Debug Interface

The debug interface features:
- Accessing board RESET and BOOT selector line
- Debug UART
- SWD Interface
- Power supply

The pin layout is designed to tolerate wrongly-connected pin header.

All data lines (SWDIO, SWCLK, RX, TX) hat to be protected against short-circuit on the debug port. (E.g. series resistors, ...)
